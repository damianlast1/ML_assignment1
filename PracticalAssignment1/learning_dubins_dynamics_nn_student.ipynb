    "The main goal for our function is not to memorize the data, which would be the result of testing if you would backtest it against its training data. The main goal is to make an estimator that works for new input data, and the only way to test is to use data that lies outside of the training data scope. Using unseen test data for the model we can look at the bias and the variance of the model. This method creates indepence of the model to new data."
